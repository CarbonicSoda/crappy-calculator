I was just bored in an afternoon and spent half an hour to write this.

This is a crappy simple calculator page (that doesn't even support brackets!!).

I'm just interested in the concept of Abstract Syntax Tree so I built this.

I once wrote a language similar to BrainF**k that does bracket balancing and stuff, and is more mature than this
(I never knew I _did_ build an AST back then!), but the source files are lost now. So this calculator
is sort of in memorial of that interpreted language lol (albeit being worse in functionalities :D).
