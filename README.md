### Crappy Calculator

A web calculator that supports custom defined
constants, unary operators (functions) and binary operators (functions).

The calculator logic is implemented with a tokenizer (lexer), a LL parser and an evaluator,

- The tokenizer is responsible for lexing the input string into lexical tokens.
- The parser is responsible for constructing an Abstract Syntax Tree from the tokens.
- The evaluator is responsible for recursively evaluating the final expression value of the tree.

> The evaluator ultimately relies on JS,
> and is thus prone to all precision errors in JS.

Brackets in the calculator are always ( and ),
with numerals essentially anything:  
1, 2.3, 0.05, 7.4e10, 10E-8, 0.1e+2 etc.  
All spaces would be ignored on tokenization (unless it breaks something apart e.g. cos â†’ c os, of course!), add them if you like.

New constants, unary operators (functions) and binary operators (functions)
can be defined in no time inside a registry, specifying some details for them
(e.g. precedence for binary operators).

> Binary operators (functions) of the same precedence are left associative
> e.g. 1-2+3 = ((1-2)+3).  
> Unary operators (functions) are right associative
> e.g. -4! = (-(4!)).

> Check the files in src/calculator/registry/, the code should be self-explanatory.

> Items symbols registered are CASE SENSITIVE.

> It is worth noting that in some cases brackets () are not needed e.g. (x)d and xd, nPr and (n)P(r), are the same.  
> However, this is not always the case, and brackets should be preferred to avoid ambiguity.  
> If not, expressions like -1^0.5 = NaN can be confusing as you might think it is equivalent to -(1^0.5),
> but it is actually interpreted as (-1)^0.5.

You can also define your own items, or mess around with the existing.
(Switching "+"s with "-"s is evilly fun lol)

Remember to play with the demo!
